# My Portfolio Web Page

## Description

This webpage is my own personal portfolio page to showcase my skills. This page is built with HTML and CSS. The page contains a headshot of myself along with different links to past projects, and social media pages of mine. I built this project using mostly flexbox and positioning styles. The project was built with a mobile-fist design, and I added media queries for a tablet and desktop size monitor.

## Usage

This webpage has a main navigation bar at the top containing my about me, projects, resume and contact anchors. If you click on any of those links they will navigate you to that section of the page. The about me section contains a short paragraph with a brief description of myself. The projects section contains four projects I currently have deployed on GitHub. Those are likely to change the further I go in my career. The contacts section have icons for GitHub, Linkdin, Instagram and Twitter. If you click on any of those icons they will navigate to each of my personal pages. Furthermore if you click on my email address you can send me an email, or if you are on mobile -- you can click on my phone number to call or text me. If you'd like to view each responsive layout you can open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) -- and decrease or increase the size of the page to see how the elements respond. I hope you enjoy!
